WHEREAS, The Mixed and Emerging Technology Integration Lab, a division of the UCF Institute for Simulation and Training, is interested in partnering with the University of Central Florida Student Government Association in providing electronic textbooks to the student body as part of a larger educational platform to be deployed in Fall 2011;

WHEREAS, The Mixed and Emerging Technology Integration Lab is interested in investigating the possibility of directing profits from the sale of textbooks back to the student body via the Activity and Service Fee Budget;

WHEREAS, Due to reducing (or eliminating) the costs of printing and shipping electronic textbooks are almost always less costly than printed versions to the buyer of the textbooks;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That preference be given to campus developers and laboratories in the development and deployment of electronic textbooks;

BE IT FURTHER RESOVLED, by the Forty-Third Student Senate of the University of Central Florida that this body would be strongly in favor of any initiative to direct profits from electronic texts back to student controlled funding; and
